Hi, I'm Nasit Sony 👋  

💡 AI Infrastructure Engineer | Distributed Systems | Consensus Protocols (BFT)  
📍 Building production-grade backend systems for AI and fault-tolerant distributed computing  

---

## 🧠 About Me
I build distributed backend systems where **correctness matters** — even under failures, partitions, and adversarial conditions.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- AI infrastructure
- Distributed systems engineering
- Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus  

I focus on treating AI systems not as simple APIs, but as **fault-tolerant distributed systems with strong correctness guarantees**.

## ⚡ Experience Snapshot

💰 **Production Systems (Fintech)**  
- Built international money transfer systems handling **$600M+ annual volume**  
- Focus: correctness, consistency, and performance under real-world constraints  

🔬 **Distributed Systems & BFT Research**  
- Published work in Springer journals and international conferences  
- Designed and implemented Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols  
- Bridging theoretical guarantees with practical system design  

🚀 **Current Focus — AI Infrastructure**  
- Building production-grade AI pipelines (SmartSearch)  
- Applying distributed systems thinking to RAG and ML systems  
- Exploring decentralized and fault-tolerant ML infrastructure

## 🔥 Featured Projects

### 🚧 SmartSearch — AI-Powered Semantic Search & RAG Backend
Production-oriented AI system built like real backend infrastructure.

**Key Features:**
- Asynchronous ingestion (Kafka → Workers → PostgreSQL)
- Embedding-based semantic search (pgvector + OpenAI)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Reliability Engineering:**
- Idempotent processing (no duplicate chunks)
- Retry + DLQ handling
- Worker crash recovery (offset-safe Kafka processing)
- Explicit lifecycle tracking (PENDING → PROCESSING → READY/FAILED)
- Eventual consistency guarantees  

👉 Focus: AI systems as distributed systems  

---

### 🌐 Cloud-Native API Gateway
Backend infrastructure system focused on **security, scalability, and reliability**.

- JWT & OAuth2 authentication
- Request routing and service orchestration
- Observability and failure handling

## 🚧 Upcoming Work

### ⚙️ LSM-based KV Store (C++)
Storage engine inspired by LSM-tree designs (RocksDB-style).

👉 Focus: durability, compaction, and performance trade-offs  

---

### ⚙️ Consensus Protocol Implementation (Rust)
Fault-tolerant distributed system inspired by Raft and BFT protocols.

👉 Focus: safety, liveness, and failure handling

⭐ I believe systems should be designed for failure — not just success.
