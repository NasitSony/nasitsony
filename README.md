# Hi, I'm Nasit Sony 👋

💡 AI Infrastructure Engineer | Distributed Systems | Consensus Protocols (BFT)  
📍 Building production-grade backend systems for AI and fault-tolerant distributed computing

## 🧠 About Me

I design and build **reliable backend systems** where AI meets distributed systems.

My work focuses on:
- Scaling AI pipelines beyond the "happy path"
- Building fault-tolerant, event-driven systems
- Designing and analyzing consensus protocols (Byzantine Fault Tolerance)

📄 Published Research:  
- *Prioritized-MVBA: A New Approach to Design an Optimal Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement Protocol* (Springer - International Journal of Information Security)
- *Slim-ABC: An Optimized Atomic Broadcast Protocol* (Springer - International Journal of Networked and Distributed Computing)

## 🔥 Featured Projects

### 🚧 SmartSearch — AI-Powered Semantic Search & RAG Backend
Production-oriented AI system built like real backend infrastructure.

**Key Features:**
- Asynchronous document ingestion (Kafka → Workers → DB)
- Embedding-based semantic search (pgvector + OpenAI embeddings)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- Explicit lifecycle tracking (PENDING → PROCESSING → READY/FAILED)

**Reliability Engineering:**
- Idempotent processing (no duplicate chunks)
- Retry + DLQ handling
- Worker crash recovery (offset-safe processing)
- Eventual consistency guarantees

👉 _Focus: Treating AI systems as distributed systems, not simple APIs_

---

### ⚙️ (Upcoming) Consensus Protocol Implementation (Rust)
Implementing fault-tolerant consensus (Raft / HotStuff-style ideas)

**Goals:**
- Leader election, log replication, fault recovery
- Simulation of failures (network partitions, node crashes)
- Performance vs correctness trade-offs

👉 _Bridging research (BFT) with real-world systems_

---

### 🏗️ Backend Infrastructure & System Design
- Cloud-native API systems (JWT, OAuth2, secure services)
- Event-driven architectures
- Observability, retries, and failure handling

⭐ *I believe AI systems should be engineered like distributed systems — with correctness, reliability, and failure handling as first-class concerns.*
